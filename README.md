- Click on any square to place the knight on the square.  
- Click on the active square to undo the last move.  
- The game is over once the knight has no place to move or all 64 squares have been completed.    
- The score(number of moves) is shown on left-top of the square.
- Recap button traverses a binary tree representation of an m-ary tree to review the last game played.
